### Sudoku Solver using OpenCV & Python

We all played sudoku at least once in our childhood. It is an exciting puzzle game. In this project, weâ€™re going to build a sudoku solver program using OpenCV. It detects a sudoku board from an image and then solves it.

First, the program will detect a sudoku board in an image and then extract only the board. Then it sees each given number from that board and then it solves the board. After solving the board it puts the decoded numbers in that original image at the same position where the board was empty. All these operations will be built with OpenCV Python and Deep learning OCR detection.
